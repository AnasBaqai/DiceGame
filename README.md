# Dice Game

The Dice Game is a simple web-based game where players take turns rolling dice and trying to achieve the highest score. It provides a fun and interactive way to enjoy a virtual dice game with friends or solo.

## How to Play

1. The game consists of multiple rounds. In each round, a player can roll the dice as many times as they want, accumulating points with each roll.

2. Each player takes turns rolling the dice. Click the "Roll Dice" button to roll the dice.

3. The points earned from each roll are added to the player's current round score.

4. However, if a player rolls a 1, their current round score is reset to zero, and their turn ends.

5. The player can choose to "Hold" their current round score at any time. The current round score is added to their total score, and it becomes the next player's turn.

6. The first player to reach the specified winning score (e.g., 100 points) wins the game.

7. Enjoy playing the Dice Game!
